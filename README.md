# Data Analysis for Green Roof Diagnostics

Green Roof Diagnostics has been testing a number of different roofing cessettes in a laboratory environment. The purpose of these tests is to collect data from a number of different points of interest (such as rain in inches, antecedent moisture condition, etc.) for the roofing cassettes under a number of different simulated storm events. More information on the company and tests can be found [here](https://www.greenroofdiagnostics.com/lab). The purpose of this repository is to highlight the initial research and analysis done to reduce dimensionality on the data, and to predict the absorption of each roofing cassette.
